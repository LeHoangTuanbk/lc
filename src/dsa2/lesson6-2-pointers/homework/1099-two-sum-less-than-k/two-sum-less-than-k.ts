export function twoSumLessThanK(nums: number[], k: number): number {}
/* 
Example 1:

Input: A = [34,23,1,24,75,33,54,8], K = 60
Output: 58
Explanation: 
We can use 34 and 24 to sum 58 which is less than 60.
Example 2:

Input: A = [10,20,30], K = 15
Output: -1
Explanation: 
In this case it's not possible to get a pair sum less that 15.
